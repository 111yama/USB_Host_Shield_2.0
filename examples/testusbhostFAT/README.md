This small sketch tests the USB host shield mass storage library.

To compile this example you will need the following libraries as well:

* [xmem2](https://github.com/xxxajk/xmem2)
* [generic_storage FATfs](https://github.com/xxxajk/generic_storage)

It is recommended to use the bundled [Makefile](Makefile).

The master makefile can be found at the following repository: <https://github.com/xxxajk/Arduino_Makefile_master>.
